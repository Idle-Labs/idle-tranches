/// delegating funds to node operators, applying fees and distributing rewards.

/// It is a non-rebasable token, which means that the amount of tokens in the user's wallet is not going to change.
/// During time, the value of this token is changing, since the amount of MATIC tokens inside the protocol is not constant.
